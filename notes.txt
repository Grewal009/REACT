function starting with "use" and can only be called at the top level of component. we canÂ´t call hook inside conditions, loops or other nested functions. 

1. useState

const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

index is local state variable. 
setIndex is setter function. The setter function update the state variable and trigger React to render the component agian. 
0 is initial value.
[] is array destructuring and let us to read values from an array.
The array returned by useState always has exactly two items.

State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.
